        <h4>Conditionally Approved</h4>

        <p> An area can be Conditionally Approved if the shellfish control authority determines that the approved area criteria can be met during a predictable periods.  These growing areas may be subject to intermittent pollution caused by discharges from wastewater treatment facilities, seasonal populations, non-point source pollution, or boating activity. The harvest conditions are specified in a Conditional Management Plan.  A conditionally approved shellfish growing area which does not meet approved growing area criteria is placed in closed status by the shellfish control authority.</p>
